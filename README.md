# Tests-for-Hg-Comagnetometer-of-n2EDM
## Repository with the data and analysis from the tests carried out for the UV laser system in the Hg co-magnetometer of the n2EDM experiment

In this repository you can currently find:
- Window Test
  - window stability: D, 
- Diode Test
  - diode comparison: D, A, R
  - diode power ramp: D, A, R (might need better output naming)
- Fiber Test
  - power meter measurements (PM): D, A, R
  - DAQ system measurements (DAQ): D,
  - fiber exposure time: A
  - fiber power rampup: D, A, R
- Power Stabilisation
  - modulation curves: D, A, R
- S130VC Detector Test
  - sensitivity map: D, A, R

Legend: D-data, A-analysis, R-results

Large datasets are compressed using the LZMA algorithm and saved as .xz files
